# Data-Cleaning

I performed data cleaning on an Excel dataset containing information on presidents, political parties, vice presidents, salaries, and dates. 

The process involved handling missing values, standardizing date and salary formats, removing duplicates, correcting inconsistencies, and validating data integrity. 

These steps ensured improved accuracy, consistency, and usability, making the dataset reliable for analysis and visualization.
